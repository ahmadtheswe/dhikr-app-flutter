    "indonesianTranslation": "Allah—there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all existence. Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they encompass nothing of His knowledge except what He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. (Al-Baqarah [2]: 255)",
